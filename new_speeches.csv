				Good morning. I’m pleased to be here with Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers to discuss our recent policy announcement and the Bank of Canada’s Monetary Policy Report (MPR).
We published our MPR as Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine entered its eighth week. The war is causing tremendous human suffering, and our hearts go out to the Ukrainian people. The war has also injected new uncertainty into the global economic outlook. It is boosting already high inflation in many countries, including Canada, and it is disrupting the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Against this backdrop we have three main messages.
First, the Canadian economy is strong. Overall, the economy has fully recovered from the pandemic, and it is now moving into excess demand.
Second, inflation is too high. It is higher than we expected, and it’s going to be elevated for longer than we previously thought.
Third, we need higher interest rates. Our policy interest rate is our primary tool to keep the economy in balance and bring inflation back to the 2% target. Two weeks ago, we raised our policy rate by 50 basis points to 1%. And we indicated Canadians should expect further increases.
Let me expand on each of these three themes.
Canadians have been through a lot in the past two years. Everyone has been touched by the pandemic, through illness or the loss of loved ones, fear and uncertainty, job loss or business closure. We experienced the sharpest and deepest recession on record. And repeated waves of the virus have made the recovery bumpy.
Thanks to exceptional monetary and fiscal stimulus, effective vaccines and a willingness to adapt and innovate, the economy has bounced back remarkably quickly. It has been the fastest and sharpest recovery ever. And now demand is beginning to run ahead of the economy’s productive capacity.
The labour market shows this clearly. Before the pandemic, Canada’s unemployment rate was 5.7%. When the pandemic hit, it quickly soared to 13.4%. And now, two years later, it is at a record low 5.3%. Job vacancies are elevated, and wage growth has reached pre-pandemic levels. Businesses can’t find enough workers to meet demand and they are telling us they’ll need to raise wages to attract and retain staff.
We expect strong growth to continue in the months ahead. As remaining public health restrictions ease, Canadians are spending more on services—travel and recreation, lodging and restaurants. And we’re still buying a lot of goods. Housing activity is still strong, and while we expect it to moderate, it will remain elevated. Business investment and exports are both picking up, and higher prices for many of the commodities Canada exports are bringing more income into the country.
Robust business investment, improved labour productivity and higher immigration should help boost the economy’s productive capacity. And higher interest rates will slow spending. Putting this all together, the Bank forecasts the Canadian economy will grow 4¼% this year, before moderating to 3¼% in 2023 and 2¼% in 2024.
That brings me to my second point—the Bank’s primary focus is inflation. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation in Canada hit a three-decade high of 6.7% in March, well above what we projected in the January MPR. The war has driven up the prices of energy and other commodities, and it is further disrupting global supply chains. While most of the factors pushing up inflation come from beyond our borders, with the economy in excess demand, we are facing domestic price pressures too. About two-thirds of CPI components are growing above 3%, which means Canadians are feeling inflation across their household budgets, from gas to groceries to rent.
Our latest outlook is for inflation to average almost 6% in the first half of 2022 and remain well above our 1% to 3% control range throughout this year. We then expect it to ease to about 2½% in the second half of 2023 before returning to the 2% target in 2024.
High inflation affects everyone. Inflation at 5% for a year—or 3 percentage points above our target—costs the average Canadian an additional $2000 a year. And it is affecting more vulnerable members of society the most, both because they spend all their income and because prices of essential items like food and energy have risen sharply. This broadening in price pressures is a big concern. It makes it more difficult for Canadians to avoid inflation, no matter how patient or prudent they are as shoppers. 
This brings me to my third point—interest rates are increasing. The economy needs higher rates and can handle them. With demand starting to run ahead of the economy’s capacity, we need higher rates to bring the economy into balance and cool domestic inflation.

We also need higher interest rates to keep Canadians’ expectations of inflation anchored on the target. We can’t control or even influence the prices of most internationally traded goods. But if Canadians’ expectations of inflation stay  anchored on the 2% target, inflation in Canada will come back down when global inflationary pressures from higher oil prices and clogged supply chains abate. 

We are committed to using our policy interest rate to return inflation to target and will do so forcefully if needed. 

Increases in the Bank’s policy rate raise the interest rates on business loans, consumer loans and mortgage loans—and they increase the return on savings. We have been clear that Canadians should expect a rising path for interest rates, but seeing their mortgage payments and other borrowing costs increase can be worrying. We will be assessing the impact of higher rates on the economy carefully. 

We recognize everyone wants to know where rates might end up—how high they will need to go. It is important to remember that we have an inflation target, not an interest rate target. This means we do not have a pre-set destination for the policy interest rate. But I can say that Canadians should expect interest rates to continue to rise toward more normal settings. By more normal we mean within the range we consider for a neutral rate of interest that neither stimulates nor weighs on the economy. We estimate this rate to be between 2% and 3%. Two weeks ago, we raised the policy rate to 1%, still well below neutral. This is also below the pre-pandemic policy rate of 1.75%. 

How high rates go will depend on how the economy responds and how the outlook for inflation evolves. The economy has entered excess demand with considerable momentum and high inflation, and we are committed to getting inflation back to target. If demand responds quickly to higher rates and inflationary pressures moderate, it may be appropriate to pause our tightening once we get closer to the neutral rate and then take stock. On the other hand, we may need to take rates modestly above neutral for a period to bring demand and supply back into balance and inflation back to target.  

Finally, let me a say a word about our balance sheet. As of this week, we are no longer replacing maturing Government of Canada bonds with new ones, so our balance sheet will shrink. This brings our exceptional monetary policy response full circle. When the economy needed exceptional support in the depth of the recession, we lowered our policy rate to its lower bound and complemented this with quantitative easing or QE. Last November we ended QE and began reinvestment. We have now moved to quantitative tightening or QT. With the economy fully recovered, it is time to normalize our balance sheet. QT will complement increases in our policy rate by putting upward pressure on longer-term interest rates. 
Let me stop here. Senior Deputy Governor Rogers and I will be happy to take your questions.

				Introduction
Good afternoon. Thank you for inviting me here as part of your study on inflation in Canada. I’m pleased to have Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers with me for her first appearance before this committee.
Since I was last here, the Bank of Canada and the Government of Canada renewed our joint agreement on Canada’s monetary policy framework. We agreed that the primary objective of monetary policy is price stability. Under the 2022–26 agreement, the cornerstone of our framework remains the 2% inflation target, at the midpoint of a 1% to 3% control range.
And earlier today I spoke to the CFA Society Toronto, where I explained our policy decision yesterday to raise our policy interest rate by 25 basis points to half a percent. I also reviewed the drivers of the recent rise in inflation globally and in Canada. I know this is directly relevant to your study, so I have given my remarks to the Clerk to share with committee members. I look forward to further exploring these issues with you today.
Before moving to your questions, I’d like to talk to you—and Canadians—about three things.
First, I’d like to review the Bank of Canada’s actions over the course of the pandemic: what we were trying to achieve, what happened and what would have happened if we hadn’t acted.
Second, I want to speak to the concerns many Canadians have about the rising cost of living. I know many people are worried about prices at the gas pump and the cost of groceries, housing affordability and how to save enough for retirement. And that angst has been compounded by everything we’ve gone through over the past two years of this pandemic.
Third, I want to talk about what’s next. This latest wave of the pandemic is fading, and life is starting to return to normal—or a new normal. I want to share what Canadians can expect to see in the economy, with inflation and from the Bank.
The Bank of Canada’s actions
At the onset of the pandemic, uncertainty skyrocketed, financial markets seized up and economic activity fell off a cliff. About 3 million Canadians lost their jobs and more than 3 million people found themselves working less than half of their normal hours. Businesses closed shop in record numbers. Inflation fell sharply, even dropping into negative numbers. We were staring down another Great Depression and the possibility of deflation.
Deflation happens when prices across the economy actually fall. While this might not sound bad, the truth is that persistent deflation is dangerous. When unemployment rises rapidly and overall prices begin to fall, households may reduce spending if they think that goods and services will become even cheaper in the future. But putting off spending results in less demand, leading to more job losses and more business closures. And this puts more downward pressure not only on prices but also on wages. Both can spiral downward, as they did in Canada during the Great Depression. Deflation also makes repaying debt more expensive—which could have been a severe problem for a country like Canada, with high levels of household debt.
So when the pandemic began and we were facing economic calamity, we took extraordinary actions. We lowered our policy interest rate as low as we could. We promised not to raise interest rates until slack in the economy was fully absorbed, and we reinforced this commitment using quantitative easing. Taken together, these actions kept borrowing rates low to stimulate spending and instilled much-needed confidence in the economy so that businesses and households could recover.
Thanks to the resilience of Canadians, effective vaccines, exceptional fiscal policy and the Bank’s actions, Canada avoided deflation and our economy has recovered.  
Canadians are anxious
But I recognize that this reassurance may not reflect how many are feeling.
Even before the pandemic, many Canadians were worried about how they were faring economically. Not everyone was experiencing the benefits of a growing economy and a healthy labour market.
The pandemic intensified people’s concerns, layering worries about their health and that of their loved ones on top of uncertainty about jobs and businesses, the value of their savings and their prospects for retirement.
Reopening the economy has brought new complications, leading to higher inflation around the world and here at home. The COVID-19 virus continues to circulate and mutate. We are seeing social upheaval here in Canada and in other countries. And in the last week, shocking developments have unfolded in Ukraine at great human cost. The unprovoked Russian invasion is also creating volatility and uncertainty in the global economy. We are living in anxious times.
Needless to say, monetary policy is not equipped to address most of these issues. But it is equipped and mandated to control inflation. Here in Canada, inflation is just above 5%. That’s too high. And with oil prices rising further in recent weeks, we can expect inflation to move up again.
I am sure people are wondering why prices are so high, so let’s unpack it.
The inflation story in Canada has three key elements. The first is that, through the pandemic many people shifted to buying more goods and fewer services. At the same time, the pandemic disrupted the production and delivery of many items. This has caused the prices of many globally traded goods to rise sharply.
The second is that price increases have seeped into an increasingly wide array of goods, including everyday items like food and energy. Oil prices are higher because of strong demand, limited investment in new production and geopolitical tensions. This means higher transportation costs, which further add to the price pressures on goods. Food prices are also being affected by extreme weather that has reduced harvests. And strong demand for housing, in the face of limited supply, has pushed those prices up.
The third is the strength of the recovery in Canada and the overall balance between demand and supply in our economy. The inflation we are experiencing today is not because of overall excess demand in the economy. A wide range of indicators suggest that slack in the economy has just now been absorbed.
But as we look ahead, spending growth needs to moderate so that demand does not significantly outpace supply and create a new domestic source of inflation. So we need to tighten monetary policy—or, to put it more simply, raise interest rates—to help control inflation.
Where do we go from here?
Let me wrap up by explaining what Canadians can expect from us going forward.
Monetary policy has a clear role in keeping supply and demand in balance and getting inflation back to target. To this end, we have taken deliberate steps to adjust the degree of monetary policy stimulus as the economy recovered—slowing our quantitative easing and then stopping it outright last October.
And we made it clear to Canadians in January that, with the economy operating at capacity, our guarantee of rock-bottom rates had ended. We need higher interest rates to bring inflation sustainably back down and keep the economy in balance.
Yesterday, Governing Council took the decision to raise the policy interest rate by 25 basis points to half a percent. And we indicated that we expect interest rates will need to rise further. We also said that we will be considering when to end the reinvestment phase of our large-scale asset purchases and allow the Bank’s holdings of Government of Canada bonds to begin to shrink. This is a process known as quantitative tightening, or QT. The timing and pace of further increases in the policy rate, and the start of QT, will be guided by the Bank’s ongoing assessment of the economy and its commitment to achieving the 2% target.
In closing, I want to emphasize to all Canadians that the Bank is determined to control inflation. With that, Senior Deputy Governor Rogers and I will be happy to take your questions.
